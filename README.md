Run the 'Astar_rigid.py' file in any python IDE or run it through command line.
When the Program is run, the user is prompted for inputs:
1. First input asks for:"Enter three values(start point with angle):"--  'x-xoordinate' of start point, 'y-coordinate' of start point, angle in degrees (orientation of robot) --> all separated by spaces ONLY. Then press enter key.
2. Second input asks for: "Enter two values (goal point):" --'x-coordinate' of goal point, 'y-coordinate' of goal point --> all separated by spaces ONLY. Then hit enter key.
3. Third input asks for: "Enter the radius and clearance (two values):"-- Enter the radius of the robot (from 0 to 4) and clearance value (from 0 to 4). Separated by spaces ONLY. Press enter key.
DISCLAIMER: Please enter the values of coordinates for both start and goal ranging from 0-300 for x and 0-200 for y-coordinate. 
Now wait and watch the plot of A* algorithm's path and exploration.
